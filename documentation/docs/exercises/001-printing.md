# Exercise 1 - The Print Function

## Goals
- Open, edit, save, and run code
- Utilize builtin functions of Python/CircuitPython

## Preparation
- Connect your board to the computer and open the `code.py` file. Delete any pre-existing code from the board. See [getting started](../getting-started.md) for help with this step.

## Concepts & Vocabulary
- Calling functions
- `print()`
- argument(s)

## Background Info

This is a very, very simple piece of code, but it'll be a great way to make sure you understand how to run code. Besides, you'll be using the `print()` function a lot, so I want to make sure you nderstand it!

The term for using a function is "calling" a function. So for instance, we will call the `print()` function in this exercise.

Remember that every function has an input, a process, and an output. A function call will start with the name of the function. In this case, the name is **print**. The name must *always* be followed by parentheses `()` for the input, even if you're not going to be putting anything inside them. If a function takes **arguments**, they go inside the parentheses. If there's more than one argument, you separate them with commas.

## Try It

Please take a moment to see if you can predict what this will do *before* you run the code.

```python
print("hello")
print("hello world")
print("a", "b", "c")'
print(1 + 1)
print("1 + 1")
print("1" + "1")
```

## Show me your code in action

To get credit for this exercise, I will need to see your code running. This will be scored for completion. If I am not available to check your work when you're ready, make sure you use `Save As` to save a copy on your computer (not only on the board!) so you can continue on and show me the code running later.
