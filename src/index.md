Instead of giving you a lot of different files or handouts, I'm creating a basic documentation site where you can find all my resources for you. This will be undergoing a lot of growth as I build it, but you'll be able to use this as a resource while you do work in my class.

Please be aware that if you ask me for help with somethign that's already detailed in here, I may tell you to go read the documentation. For anything you want more info on, please let me know and I'll be happy to add it here if relevant, even if I hadn't originally planned on including it.
