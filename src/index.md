Instead of giving you a ton of different files or handouts, I've created a simple documentation website where I'll share all my resources for you. I'll still create assignments in Google Classroom where you can submit any work you aren't able to show me during class, but most of my material will be posted here.

Please be aware that if you ask me for help with something that's already in here, I might ask you to start by looking at the relevant page. If there's anything not here that you'd like me to post, please let me know.
