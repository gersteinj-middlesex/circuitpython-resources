# Control Structures

Normally, lines of code run in order, but you can change the way the computer moves through your code. This section will focus on conditional statements (if/elif/else) and loops (for and while)

## Conditional Statements

### If

### If-Else

### If-Elif-Else

## Loops

Loops cause code to run repeatedly

### While Loops

While loops run code as long as the condition described in the logical test is true.

**Real World Examples**
- Breathe. Repeat for the rest of your life.
- While you are hungry, eat
- While an unauthorized person is in your supervillain lair, fire lasers at them

### For Loops

For loops will iterate through a set of items, such as a list of names, a range of numbers, or the contents of a folder.

**Real World Examples**
- Print all the items in a player's inventory (for each item in the inventory, print the item's name)
- Give each student in the class a cupcake (for each student, give them a cupcake)
-
